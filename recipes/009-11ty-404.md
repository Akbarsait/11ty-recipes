### Directions
1. Create a file in your project root called **404.md** and add the following:

```md
---
title: Oops! Not Found
layout: base
permalink: /404.html
---

This is where you should tell the user how to find their content. Maybe on the [home page?](./)
```

The actual contents can vary of course, but in general a good 404 page informs the user the content they wanted was not found and attempts to give them resources to find what
they were looking for.

2. Depending your platform, your job is done. On Netlify and GitHub pages, they will automatically load this file when a page is not found. For other platforms, check their documentation
to see how to specify which file/URL is used when a page is not found.
