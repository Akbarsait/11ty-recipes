There's a ton of great Eleventy starter kits out there but they're pretty opinionated about their features and dependencies. 11ty.recipes helps you build an Eleventy site from scratch, showing you how to add individual features like a SASS pipeline or image sprite generation to craft the exact site you need.

## Recipes

1. [Start an Eleventy site from scratch](/recipes/start-an-eleventy-site-from-scratch/)
2. [Create a Github repository for your Eleventy site](/recipes/create-a-github-repository-for-your-eleventy-site/)
3. [Deploy your Eleventy site to Netlify](/recipes/deploy-your-eleventy-site-to-netlify/)
